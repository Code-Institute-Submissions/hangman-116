# Hangman

Hangman is a classic and popular online word guessing game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The game begins with the user having the option to read the rules or create a username and select a difficulty level, ranging from easy to hard.

Once the game has started, the user is prompted to guess a letter, and if they are correct, a message will indicate the correct letter placement, and the gallows and previously guessed letters will be displayed. However, if the user guesses incorrectly, they will receive an incorrect message and the gallows will be updated with a penalty, moving them one step closer to losing the game.

Overall, Hangman is a fun and challenging game that requires both guessing skills and vocabulary knowledge, making it a great way to test your abilities and have fun at the same time.
